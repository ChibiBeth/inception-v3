<br/><br/>
A generic image classifier program using Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html).

This model has been pre-trained for the  ImageNet (http://image-net.org/) data, it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes
The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify a new set of images.

This is a generic setup and can be used to classify almost any kind of image. 

## Installation
Make sure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) installed, then install Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) on your system, and clone this repo.

<br/>

## Usage

The usage is described in this article at the bottom half, simply follow the steps:<br/>
